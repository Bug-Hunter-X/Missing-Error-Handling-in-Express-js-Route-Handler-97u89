# Express.js Route Handler Bug: Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: lack of error handling for invalid input.

The `bug.js` file contains code with the error.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.

The issue is that the route handler attempts to parse a user ID from the request parameters as an integer, but it doesn't handle the scenario where the ID is not a valid integer. This could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or vulnerabilities.

The solution involves adding explicit error handling to gracefully manage such cases.
